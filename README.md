ABOUT ME:
Hi! I'm Daniele Persichetti, currently a senior student at SUNY New Paltz pursuing a course in web programming. 
My journey with computers began with simple curiosity as a kid, and it evolved into a structured learning path in computer science when I decided to study at Westchester Community College, 
where I successfully completed my Associate's degree. My favorite courses were programming 1-2 and data structures, because the projects we worked on were so challenging and fun that they kept me invested throughout
the whole semester. Currently other than being a student, I work as an IT Consultant using mostly microsoft technologies like Azure, Intune, and M365, that taught me system administrator skills like managing users,
devices, and monitoring for security threats.

 Working closely with Azure and M365 has particularly sparked my interest in how web-based systems function, which led me to take this course in web programming. I am excited about how this web programming course
 will help improve my skills, but more importantly help me learn and expand my knowledge of web-based technologies. I don't currently have a plan for what I will do with these skills, but
 I'm sure that they will come in handy eventually.
